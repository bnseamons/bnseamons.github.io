    <p><br>Hi! I am a 2021 graduate of UC Berkeley where I am majored in mechanical engineering. Throughout my time at Berkeley I developed a passion for software.  As such I have decided to start my career at Amazon where I am a software engineering working on AWS Glue.

            <h3> Projects </h3>
            <h5> JARL (Just Another Robotic Limb) </h5>
            <p> JARL is a prosthetic arm I have been developing for a quadriplegic patient. The current model has 5 degrees of freedom and mounts to side of a wheel chair and allows users to perform tasks such
               as pushing elevator buttons and drinking from a cup. The user operates the arm from an Android app that sends commands to the Arduino controlling our arm.<br>

            <h5> ItemEyes </h5>
            <p> ItemEyes is an app designed to help users keep track of purchase information. It has two main parts. On the POS (point of sale) side, the software I developed
              saves receipt information in a QR code that can be printed on receipts. On the user side, the web app, designed in JavaScript, HMTL and CSS reads in the information
              and appends it to a database of purchases. The app was designed while working with our mentor, who is blind, and is aimed to help those who can note see keep track of purchase information
              The app was first designed for iOS to take advantage of Apple's accessibilites features for the visually impaired.

            <h5>Gitlet </h5>
            <p> Gitlet is a clone of the Git version control system I coded in java to expand my understanding of Git. I implemented many local functions including the following: init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log
              status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge. I also implemented remote commands such as the following: add-remote, rm-remote, push, fetch, and pull.

            <h5>Tablut </h5>
            <p> Tablut is a strategy game played between two players on a chess board. I used java to implement the game and an AI.
              The AI used the mini-max algorithm to select a move, and was efficient due to alpha-beta pruning I implemented.

              <h5> Software Engineer </h5>
              <h6> AWS (Amazon Web Services) (July 2021 - Present)- East Palo Alto, CA </h6>
              <p>Engineer assigned to work on AWS Glue.
              </p>
              <h5> Hardware Engineering Intern </h5>
              <h6> General Motors (Summer 2020)- Warren, MI </h6>
              <p>I worked on two main projects; I worked on a manufacturing project based at GM's largest transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio. I worked to improve the production of a particular part used in 2 GM transmissions. I
                did this by writing PLC programs to automate the collection of data so operators could run multiple parts at one time. I also wrote a Python script that extracted this data from the system log and plugged it into
                 a report template that needed to be produced once per shift (every 8 hours). I was fortunate enough to work in-person on this project. My second project was working on the lane keep assist program being deployed on new cars.
                 This involed stardardizing the camera software used in testing to simplify the data analysis process. I also worked on the algorithm cars use to determine where the edge of a lane is when there is no painted lane dividers on the road.
                 I worked on the project remotely. In addition to these two projects, I volunteered to help at an assembly plant when GM was severely short staffed and needed help.

              <h5> Mechanical Engineering Engineering Intern </h5>
              <h6>Phoenix Deventures (Summer 2019)- Morgan Hill, CA </h6>
              <p>Phoenix Deventures is a medical device consulting company that works with other biotech companies to rapidly impove their technology.
                I worked on two main projects; The first was writing a C program to automate testing of needles from a client. Phoneix had to run 100% inspection on these needles which meant one technican had to dedicate
                their entire day to manually testing needles. My program automated the test itself and a technican was only needed to swap out the needles between tests. Second, I developed the alogrithm that controls
                robots that package parts when they are leaving the clean room. As a medical device company, sterilization is of uptmost importance so the robot packages parts produced in the clean room. My modifications
                resulted in 10% more parts per day by simplifying the process. Last, I worte a Python script that auotmated the creation of Engineering Change Order reports, reports that have to be created anytime a
                change is made to a client's part

              <h6>UC Berkeley Engineering Center(March 2019 - May 2021)- Berkeley, CA </h6>
              <p>The Center for Access to Engineering Excellence is a tutoring center at UC Berkeley where I tutor in several introductory Mechanical Engineering courses.
                I create worksheets to help students, and I also was able to adapt and move all my tutoring online to Google Hangouts to continue helping students during the
                COVID-19 pandemic.
