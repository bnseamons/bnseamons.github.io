    <p><br>Hi! I am a recent graduate of UC Berkeley and a software engineer at AWS where I work on Glue, a serverless data integration product. I am looking to explore more fields of computer science through new projects and job opportunities.
      Outside of my career, I am an avid photographer, soccer player, and love Latin music and dance!

            <h5> JARL (Just Another Robotic Limb) </h5>
            <p> JARL is a prosthetic arm I have been developing for a quadriplegic patient. The current model has 5 degrees of freedom and mounts to side of a wheel chair and allows users to perform tasks such
               as pushing elevator buttons and drinking from a cup. The user operates the arm from an Android app that sends commands to the Arduino controlling our arm.<br>

            <h5> ItemEyes </h5>
            <p> ItemEyes is an app designed to help users keep track of purchase information. It has two main parts. On the POS (point of sale) side, the software I developed
              saves receipt information in a QR code that can be printed on receipts. On the user side, the web app, designed in JavaScript, HMTL and CSS reads in the information
              and appends it to a database of purchases. The app was designed while working with our mentor, who is blind, and is aimed to help those who can note see keep track of purchase information
              The app was first designed for iOS to take advantage of Apple's accessibilites features for the visually impaired.

              <h3> Experience </h3>
              <h5> Software Engineer </h5>
              <h7> Amazon Web Services (AWS) Glue (July 2021 - Present)- Palo Alto, CA </h7>
              <p> Glue is a rapidly growing serverless data integration product. Because of this rapid growth, many parts of Glue's infrastructure are being pushed to their limits. To help prepare for future growth, I led major team infrastructure changes.
                The first of which was designing a new DynamoDB system that reduced the team's DynamoDB related alarms by 90%. With this system, I led the, design, development, and deployment. I designed and executed
                 a 2 phase roll out plan to make sure changes could be rolled back if needed.
                 Second, I drove migration to a new distributed system architecture that improved utilization and reduced costs.
                 To monitor this new architecture, I designed an online dashboard that synthesized various key metrics.
                 I also researched correlation between new instance parameters and a variety of results such as latency, utilization, availability to optimize usage of new instances.
                 Because Glue deals with large amounts of customer data, security is of uptmost importance.
                 I designed a security system to keep track of unexpected account activity and respond to security threats.
                 I researched existing AWS security products and spoke to various teams on best ways to integrate them for Glue’s needs.
                 As with any new system, there are limitations to navigate. I drove design meetings to make decisions on needed functionality of the system and how to navigate these limitations.
                 In addition to these larger projects, I worked on bug fixes and features with a two week turn around.
                 I insisted on high standards of testing to ensure confidence deployment to production.
                 I also worked as a pageable on-call that responded to urgent deployment and customer issues.
                 I used Cloudwatch, Cloudtrail, Athena, and other AWS products to diagnose both internal and customer tickets,
                 and I kept a thorough work log in ticket to maintain communication with customers while diving deep into issues.

              <h5> Hardware Engineering Intern </h5>
              <h7> General Motors (Summer 2020)- Warren, MI </h7>
              <p>I worked on two main projects; first, I worked on a manufacturing project based at GM's largest transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio. I worked to improve the production of a particular part used in 2 GM transmissions. I
                did this by writing PLC programs to automate the collection of data so operators could run multiple parts at one time. I also wrote a Python script that extracted this data from the system log and plugged it into
                 a report template that needed to be produced once per shift (every 8 hours). I was fortunate enough to work in-person on this project. My second project was working on the lane keep assist program being deployed on new cars.
                 This involed stardardizing the camera software used in testing to simplify the data analysis process. I also worked on the algorithm cars use to determine where the edge of a lane is when there is no painted lane dividers on the road.
                 I worked on the project remotely. In addition to these two projects, I volunteered to help at an assembly plant when GM was severely short staffed and needed help.

              <h5> Software Engineer Intern </h5>
              <h7>Phoenix Deventures (Summer 2019)- San Jose, CA </h7>
              <p>Phoenix Deventures is a medical device consulting company that works with other biotech companies to rapidly impove their technology.
                I worked on two main projects; The first was writing a C program to automate testing of needles from a client. Phoneix had to run 100% inspection on these needles which meant one technican had to dedicate
                their entire day to manually testing needles. My program automated the test itself and a technican was only needed to swap out the needles between tests. Second, I developed the alogrithm that controls
                robots that package parts when they are leaving the clean room. As a medical device company, sterilization is of uptmost importance so the robot packages parts produced in the clean room. My modifications
                resulted in 10% more parts per day by simplifying the process. Last, I worte a Python script that auotmated the creation of Engineering Change Order reports, reports that have to be created anytime a
                change is made to a client's part
                </thead>

              <h5> Tutor </h6>
              <h7>UC Berkeley Engineering Center(March 2019 - May 2021)- Berkeley, CA </h7>
              <p>The Center for Access to Engineering Excellence is a tutoring center at UC Berkeley where I tutor in several introductory Mechanical Engineering courses.
                I create worksheets to help students, and I also was able to adapt and move all my tutoring online to Google Hangouts to continue helping students during the
                COVID-19 pandemic.
