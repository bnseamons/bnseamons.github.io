    <p><br>Hi! I am a senior at UC Berkeley where I am majoring in mechanical engineering with a minor in electrical engineering and computer science. I am looking to explore robotics and computer science more through new projects, classes, and internships.
      Outside of my career, I am an avid photographer, soccer player, and love Latin music and dance!

            <h3> Projects </h3>
            <h5> JARL (Just Another Robotic Limb) </h5>
            <p> JARL is an prosthetic arm I have been developing for a quadriplegic patient. The current model has 5 degrees of freedom and mounts to side of a wheel chair and allows users to perform tasks such
               as pushing elevator buttons and drinking from a cup. The user operates the arm from an Android app that sends commands to the Arduino controlling our arm.<br>
              <a href="https://a360.co/2JdClco"> CAD assembly</a>
            </p>
            <h5> ItemEyes </h5>
            <p> ItemEyes is an app designed to help users keep track of purchase information. It has two main parts. On the POS (point of sale) side, the software I developed
              saves receipt information in a QR code that can be printed on receipts. On the user side, the web app, designed in JavaScript, HMTL and CSS reads in the information
              and appends it to a database of purchases. The app was designed while working with our mentor, who is blind, and is aimed to help those who can note see keep track of purchase information
              The app was first designed for iOS to take advantage of Apple's accessibilites features for the visually impaired.

            <h5>Gitlet </h5>
            <p> Gitlet is a clone of the Git version control system I coded in java to expand my understanding of Git. I implemented many local functions including the following: init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log
              status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge. I also implemented remote commands such as the following: add-remote, rm-remote, push, fetch, and pull.

            </p>
            <h5>Tablut </h5>
            <p> Tablut is a strategy game played between two players on a chess board. I used java to implement the game and an AI.
              The AI used the mini-max algorithm to select a move, and was efficient due to alpha-beta pruning I implemented.

              <h3> Experience </h3>
              <h5> Hardware Engineering Intern </h5>
              <h7> General Motors (Summer 2020)- Warren, MI </h7>
              <p>I worked on two main projects; I worked on a manufacturing project based at GM's largest transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio. I worked to improve the production of a particular part used in 2 GM transmissions.
                I was fortunate enough to work in-person on this project. My second project was working on the lane keep assist program being deployed on new cars. I worked on the project remotely.
                In addition to these two projects, I volunteered to help at an assembly plant when GM was severely short staffed and needed help.
              </p>
              <h5> Mechanical Engineering Intern </h5>
              <h7>Phoenix Deventures (Summer 2019)- Morgan Hill, CA </h7>
              <p>Phoenix Deventures is a medical device consulting company that works with other biotech companies to rapidly impove their technology.
                I worked on two main projects; I worked with Medtronic to use Solidworks to design an attachment for the end of a catheter. I also designed and
                manufactured a metal fixture for a tensile testing machine.
              </p>
              <h5> Tutor </h6>
              <h7>UC Berkeley Engineering Center(March 2019-Present)- Berkeley, CA </h7>
              <p>The Center for Access to Engineering Excellence is a tutoring center at UC Berkeley where I tutor in several introductory Mechanical Engineering courses.
                I create worksheets to help students, and I also was able to adapt and move all my tutoring online to Google Hangouts to continue helping students during the
                COVID-19 pandemic.
