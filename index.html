    <p><br>Hi! I am a junior at UC Berkeley where I am majoring in mechanical engineering with a minor in electrical engineering and computer science. I am looking to explore robotics and computer science more through new projects, classes, and internships.
      Outisde of my career, I am an avid photographer, soccer player, and love Latin music and dance!

            <h6> JARL (Just Another Robotic Limb) </h6>
            <p> JARL is an prosthetic arm I have been developing for a quadriplegic patient. The current model has 5 degrees of freedom and mounts to side of a wheel chair and allows users to perform tasks such
               as pushing elevator buttons and drinking from a cup. The user operates from an Android app that sends commands to our arm which is powered by an Arduino.<br>

            <h6> ItemEyes </h6>
            <p> ItemEyes is an app designed to help users keep track of purchase information. It has two main parts. On the POS (point of sale) side, the software I developed
              saves receipt information in a QR code that can be printed on receipts. On the user side, the web app, designed in JavaScript, HMTL and CSS reads in the information
              and appends it to a database of purchases. The app was designed while working with a blind citizen, and is aimed to help those who can note see keep track of purchase information
              The app was first designed for iOS to take advantage of Apple's accessibilites features for the visually impaired. <br>

            <h6>Gitlet </h6>
            <p> Gitlet is a clone of the Git version control system I expand my understanding of Git. I many local functions in my version including the following: init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log
              status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge. I also implemented remote commands such as the following add-remote, rm-remote, push, fetch, and pull.<br>

            </p>
            <h6>Tablut </h6>
            <p> Tablut is a strategy game played between two players on a chess board. I used java to implement the game, and I designed an AI to play against.
              The AI used the mini-max algorithm to select a move, and was efficient due to alpha-beta pruning I implemented.<br>
